  ingredients: `6 egg whites or 100g crumbled extra firm tofu,
                ½ cup chopped broccolini or broccoli
                ¼ cup halved cherry tomatoes
                ¼ cup sliced mushrooms
                1 cup kale - torn into pieces
                ½ cup grated carrot
                ½ teaspoon yellow curry powder
                ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
                ¼ teaspoon onion powder
                ¼ teaspoon paprika
                ¼ teaspoon salt
                ⅛ teaspoon pepper
                1 halved lime
                ½ cup cooked quinoa
                ¼ sliced avocado
                ¼ cup deli sprouts or micro-greens`,
  directions: `Heat a wok or saucepan at medium to high heat.
In a small bowl mix together the spices and salt and pepper.
When the wok/pan is nice and hot add in broccolini, carrot, and mushrooms and a splash of water, cook for 3-4 minutes until the vegetable become tender.
Reduce heat to medium and add in the kale and cherry tomatoes and spice mix, continue sauteing until the kale is wilted, add little splashes of water as needed so the vegetables do not stick or burn.
Squeeze in the juice of half a lime and pour in the egg whites. Allow the egg whites to sit for a minute until they begin to cook through, then scramble them together with the vegetables. (If you are using tofu just scramble with the vegetables until the tofu begins to brown slightly or heats through).
Once the eggs are cooked fully, transfer the mixture to a bowl with quinoa and top the quinoa.
Top the vegetable mixture with sliced avocado and sprouts, and garnish with another squeeze of lime and some additional salt and pepper if preferred.
Enjoy!`,
